My pronouns are whatever you feel like, but most people use he/him with me. This website serves as a new blog for me, just somewhere to capture some thoughts and share things I find interesting.
About me: I am a software development team leader by trade. I believe very deeply in the principles of servant leadership and find great joy in helping others be successful.</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>http://michaeltoddlewis.com/posts/first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 20:27:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://michaeltoddlewis.com/posts/first-post/</guid><description>This is my first post on my new site.
