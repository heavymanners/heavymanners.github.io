My pronouns are whatever you feel like, but most people use he/him with me. This website serves as a new blog for me, just somewhere to capture some thoughts and share things I find interesting.
About me: I am a software development team leader by trade. I believe very deeply in the principles of servant leadership and find great joy in helping others be successful.</description></item></channel></rss>
