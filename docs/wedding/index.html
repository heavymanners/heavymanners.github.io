<h2>SERMON</h2>
<p>Welcome, friends and family, to this joyous celebration of love. Today, we gather to witness as Nikki and Brandon commit themselves to one another and to wish them well as they begin a new chapter in their lives together.</p>

<p>As I prepared for this day and reflected on Nikki and Brandon's journey, I was reminded that true, lasting love is not just about meeting the right person. It is also about meeting them at the right time. As some of you may know, Nikki and Brandon have been almost meeting for most of their lives. They grew up in the same town, even lived in the same neighborhood for a time. They went to the same school. They had mutual friends. Brandon used to actually cross Nikki's back yard to visit a friend of his that was also a friend of hers. Time after time they could have met, but through some twist of fate that never happened.</p>

<p>We do not know how their story would have turned out if they had met any of those times. We can guess they would have fallen in love; they would have been meeting the right person, after all. But falling in love is the easy part. It's the staying in love that matters. It is staying in love that they are committing to today. </p>

<p>In the years that Nikki and Brandon were just missing each other, they have experienced all of the ups and downs that life can throw at a person. Their hearts have been full and their hearts have been broken. They have had false starts and amazing successes. They have lost loved ones, and they have brought new life and joy into the world through their incredible children. These experiences have shaped who they are today. They have made Nikki and Brandon stronger, wiser, more patient, more caring. And these qualities, that wisdom and patience create the right conditions for their love to flourish and last.</p>

<p>Nikki, Brandon, you have met the right person, and now is the right time. You have earned this moment. But the words we say today have no special power. These words cannot guarantee you a long and happy marriage; only your continued love and respect for one another can give you that. As you take steps into this future together, you do so as partners and equals. Over the years to come you will rely on those qualities that you have built through years past. You will need to be patient and caring with each other, honest, and fully commited to one another and to your family. True, lasting love demands all of this.  </p>

<h2>DECLARATION and VOWS</h2> 
(joint option / less repetitive)

<p>Understanding all of this, do you, Nikki and Brandon, declare now in the presence of your friends and family that you choose each other, to join together from this day forth as partners in the adventure that lies ahead? If so, answer now "we do" (we do)</p>

<p>Do you promise to walk by each other's side to the ends of the Earth, to love, encourage, and support one another in every endeavor? If so, answer now "we do" (we do)</p>

<p>Do you commit to opening yourselves up completely to one another, to share your entire being? To share in the laughter and the tears? If so, answer now "we do" (we do)</p>

<p>Do you, Nikki and Brandon, take each other as your partner in life, your constant friend, and one true love for now until the end of time? If so, answer now "we do" (we do)</p>

<h2>RING EXCHANGE</h2>

<p>The wedding ring is a symbol of the commitment that Nikki and Brandon are making today. The unbroken circle, with no beginning and no end, represents unity everlasting, reflecting the love that lives in their hearts.</p>

<p>Nikki, please place the ring on Brandon's finger and repeat after me: 

"Brandon, I give you this ring as a symbol of my promise to love you forever. May it ever remind you of your place in my heart, and remind others of my commitment to our shared happiness."</p>

<p>Brandon, please place the ring on Brandon's finger and repeat after me: 

"Nikki, I give you this ring as a symbol of my promise to love you forever. May it ever remind you of your place in my heart, and remind others of my commitment to our shared happiness."</p>

<h2>CLOSING</h2>

<p>Nikki, Brandon, you have no affirmed your love for and commitment to one another in the presence of your friends and family. As you venture forth together, you do so with our deepest support. Many long years from now, may you look to one another and say, "With you I have lived the life I have always wanted to live. I am so glad to have met you at the right time."</p>

<p>By the power vested in me by the commonwealth of Kentucky and by your wishes, it is my great honor to pronounce you husband and wife. Please seal this union with a kiss.</p>
