<h2>SERMON</h2>

Welcome, friends and family, and thank you for joining us today in this joyous celebration. Today we gather to witness as Nick and Amanda commit themselves to one another, and to wish them well as they take these next steps on their journey together.

For those of you who don't know me, my name is Mike Lewis, and I have had the great fortune of calling Nick and Amanda friends for more than a decade now. Like many relationships that hasn't been linear, we've come into and out of each others' lives over the years.

As I prepared for today and reflected on the nature of relationships and on Nick and Amanda's story, I kept coming back to that idea of life as a journey. It's a cliche, but it's an apt one. Each day we stride forward into an uncertain future, informed by our pasts, the road being paved in front of us as we walk. 

And throughout our lives, people come to share that road with us. Some walk alongside us only briefly, some for longer, a select few for the rest of our days. Each of these people gives us perspective on where we've been and they help to shape where we're headed. We cannot choose who comes into our lives, but we can choose who to continue traveling with.

When Nick and Amanda first met, they were are pretty different paths. 

Nick was just coming out of a long term relationship. He was preparing for a globe-spanning adventure, and he had plans to try carving out his own unique career path. The road Nick was on wasn't built for settling down, for commitment and family, not yet.

Amanda was on her own journey. She was in a relationship, and she was well underway on her own adventure of raising her awesome kids and figuring out how to balance career and family and what it means to be a mom in this world today.

So their paths diverged pretty quickly at first. But in that brief time they shared the road, a seed was planted, a feeling that they had met someone they wanted to walk alongside some more. And over the intervening years, it took root and grew, until finally they chose to come back together, to join hands and see where the road could lead.

They've quickly found that the road has lead to real happiness. Nick has built an amazing relationship with the kids, and together they've become a family. They've created a life together that even in the small moments, even in the just bumming around town or binge-watching a tv show moments, leaves them feeling fulfilled and full of love. And today they have come here to commit to seeing this journey through together.

Nick, Amanda, the roads you've traveled have lead you to this moment, as you step into this future together, you do so as partners and equals. Over the years to come you will rely on all of the experiences of your past to give you the courage and wisdom to make this work. The story books like to talk about true love as unconditional, but the truth is that lasting love has conditions. You will need to be patient and caring with each other. You will need to be strong to lift one another up. To be honest and fully committed to your partner and your family. True, lasting love, demands all of these things. 

  <h2>DECLARATION AND VOWS</h2>

Understanding all of this, do you, Nick and Amanda, declare now in the presence of these witnesses that you choose each other, to join together from this day forth as partners in the adventure that lies ahead? If so, answer now, "we do".

Nick and Amanda have prepared some vows.

  <h2>CLOSING</h2>

Nick, Amanda, you have now affirmed your love for and commitment to one another in the presence of your friends and family. As you venture forth together, you do so with our deepest support. We are all very excited to see where the road leads you from here. 

Now, by the power vested in me by the Commonwealth of Kentucky and by your wishes, it is my great honor to pronounce you husband and wife. Please seal this union with a kiss.
