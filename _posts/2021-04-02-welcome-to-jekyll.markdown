So this is me testing out `Jekyll` which is an interesting exercise for me. Does just saving this work? Or do I really have to build again?


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight csharp %}
public class ExampleClass : IExample
{
  private int _foo = 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
