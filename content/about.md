My name is Michael Todd Lewis, though my friends call me Bigtime, or more often Biggie or just Big. My pronouns are whatever you feel like, but most people use he/him with me. This website serves as a new blog for me, just somewhere to capture some thoughts and share things I find interesting. 

About me: 
I am a software development team leader by trade. I believe very deeply in the principles of servant leadership and find great joy in helping others be successful.

I also dabble in creating art, making music, and writing. I am tattoo collector. I love dogs. I love music and art and reading. I enjoy hiking and trying new restaurants or visiting old favorites. I like laughing with my friends. 

Life isn't just for surviving. It's for joy and meaning and fulfillment. Not just bread, but roses too. 

I am a socialist and an atheist but have found plenty of common ground with people of other worldviews. However, I am completely intolerant of racism and all forms of gender- or sex-based bigotry.
