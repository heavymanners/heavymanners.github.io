My name is Michael Todd Lewis, though my friends call me Bigtime, or more often Biggie or just Big. My pronouns are whatever you feel like, but most people use he/him with me. This website serves as a new blog for me, just somewhere to capture some thoughts and share things I find interesting. 

About me: 
I am a software development team leader by trade. I believe very deeply in the principles of servant leadership and find great joy in helping others be successful.

I also dabble in creating art, making music, and writing. I am tattoo collector. I love dogs. I love music and art and reading. I enjoy hiking and trying new restaurants or visiting old favorites. I like laughing with my friends. 

Life isn't just for surviving. It's for joy and meaning and fulfillment. Not just bread, but roses too.
