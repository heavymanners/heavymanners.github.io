I kicked off 2021 by finishing up Rebecca Roanhorse's mind-blowing apocalyptic fantasy ***Black Sun***, the best fantasy book I've read since reading Abercrombie's ***First Law*** trilogy. Over the next twelve months I read something in the neighborhood of thirty books, ranging from dystopian science fiction to historical fantasy, violent noir to family drama. I revisited old favorites and explored new (to me) authors from around the globe.

By far the most thought-provoking read of the year was ***Tender is the Flesh*** by Agustina Bazterrica. This grotesque dystopian novel rewards readers who power through stomach-turning passages with an exploration of the silence we as people respond with in the face of every-day atrocities. Eleven months later, and I still regularly think about this book.

Rounding out my unintentional theme of apocalypse and plague, Christopher Buehlman's ***Between Two Fires*** was another highlight from the year. A fever dream odyssey across France during the height of the Black Death, the story presents plague-ridden Europe as a literal hell on Earth, a playground for devils and demons as God has his eye elsewhere. But despite the horrors, there is a thread of hope throughout.

Other highlights from the year included the rollicking magical realism of ***Raise a Holler***, the pot-boiling noir of ***Blacktop Wasteland***, the visceral gut punch of ***Between the World and Me***, and a long-overdue revisit of one of my all-time favorite books ***Ordinary People***.
